Given some categorized constants in the form "category: constant_1; constant_2; ...; constant_n" and some predicates about the relation among different categories of constants, write ASP (Answer Set Programming) rules to generate the search space of possible relations.

Constants:
employee: "Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha".
price: 225; 275; 325.
wood_type: "ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood".

Predicates:
% The categories include employee, price, and wood_type. We use different variables E, P, and W to represent employee, price, and wood_type.
% We match an employee E with price P and wood type W, where E belongs to employee, P belongs to price, and W belongs to wood_type.
match(E, P, W)

ASP Rules:
% Define the constants in each category.
employee("Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha").
price(225; 275; 325).
wood_type("ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood").
% For each employee E, it matches with exactly 1 price P and 1 wood type W.
{match(E, P, W): price(P), wood_type(W)}=1 :- employee(E).
